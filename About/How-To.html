    <h2 id="earn-interest-on-beans">Earn Interest on Beans</h2>
    <p>There are 2 ways to earn interest directly from Beanstalk:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#become-a-silo-member">Become a Silo Member</a></li>
      <li><a href="#become-a-bean-farmer">Become a Bean Farmer</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Beanstalk website facilitates Buying and Depositing directly from ETH, Claiming and Depositing, and Buying and Sowing directly from ETH, in single transactions. Users can also Buy and Deposit LP Tokens directly from Beans. In each module, there is a settings module that lets you customize your transaction.</p>
    <h3 id="become-a-silo-member">Become a Silo Member</h3>
    <p>Anyone can become a Silo Member by Depositing Beans or LP Tokens for the Bean: ETH Uniswap liquidity pool into the Silo. Upon Deposit, Silo Members receive Stalk and Seeds. Stalk is the governance token of Beanstalk. Every season, each Seed yields .0001 additional Stalk. Additional Stalk must be manually Claimed to begin earning interest.</p>
    <p>At the beginning of each Season, if the Bean supply increases, a portion of the new supply is distributed to Stalk holders in proportion to their Stalk ownership. All Bean distributions to Silo Members are automatically Deposited into the Silo, and receive Stalk and Seeds. Additional Stalk that grows from new Seeds do not need to be manually claimed until after your next interaction with the Silo. After your next interaction with the Silo, any additional Stalk from Seeds owned at the time of your interaction with the Silo must be manually claimed.</p>
    <p>Assets can be Withdrawn from the Silo at anytime, and become liquid at the start of the 25th Season after Withdrawal. All Stalk and Seeds associated with a Deposit are forfeited upon Withdrawal.</p>

    <p>There are a lot of different assets in the Beanstalk ecosystem. The Balances section contains a complete summary of both your assets in the ecosystem, and the totals for the entire Beanstalk ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Bean values are denominated in Beans. LP Token values are small decimals. If you hover over an amount of LP with your mouse, the website displays the Beans and ETH under that LP Token amount.</p>
    <p>Bean and LP Deposits and Withdrawals are listed individually in the "Silo" section.</p>
    <p>Whenever you have assets Deposited in the Silo and are rewarded with new Beans or Stalk, they will appear with your Bean Deposits listed as Rewarded. The next time you perform a transaction in the Silo, Rewarded Beans and Stalk will be grouped into a Bean Deposit and removed from the Rewarded section.</p>
    <h2 id="participate-in-governance">Participate in Governance</h2>
    <p>Beanstalk is governed by Stalk holders. Anytime there is an outstanding Beanstalk Improvement Proposal (BIP) being considered, a “BIPs” button will appear in the navigation bar at the top of the website. When there are no outstanding BIPs, you can still review previous BIPs by scrolling down to the “BIPs” section of the website.</p>

    <h2 id="use-beans">Use Beans</h2>
    <p>Beanstalk is designed to interoperate with the entire Ethereum ecosystem. No actions are ever required from everyday Bean users. Over time, as Beanstalk demonstrates utility by consistently returning the Bean price to $1, we expect Beans to be incorporated into various other Ethereum-native protocols. Let your favorite dApps know you want them to incorporate Beans in their protocol!</p>
    <p>Today, you can use your Beans to participate in Bean Farming and Beanstalk Governance.</p>
